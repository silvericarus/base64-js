<h2>This application is designed to help you and me understand and study the usage of Base64 encryption.</h2>
Base64 is a popular encoding method used to represent binary data as ASCII characters. It is commonly used in various applications, including data transmission and storing binary data in text-based formats.
<h3>How does Base64 works?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>You transform the characters in the input to binary (base-2)</li>
  <li>You split the stream in groups of 6 characters (6 bits)</li>
  <li>You transform each of the groups into the number that group represents, using base-10</li>
  <li>Convert each of this numbers into the character it represents, using the table below</li>
  <li>If needed, newlines are added to keep textline below 76 chars, if a 6 numbers group is not complete, the pad symbol is added (=)</li>
</ol>
